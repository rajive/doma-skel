## Purpose

Service names definitions.

Define the *constants* used to define a service interface.


## Organization

Constants are defined in IDL files, organized as appropriate. 

- `<name>`_svc_t.idl
   - datatypes used by the service `<name>`
   - define the string constants for entity names used in the 
     `if/<name>_svc.xml` file
