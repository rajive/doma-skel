The [databus](doc/doma/Bus.md) project comprises of:

- A common [Data Model](doc/doma/DataModel.md), and
- Component Micro-Service [Interfaces](doc/doma/Interface.md)
  that use the common data model


The databus project does not contain component implementations.
Many components implementations are possible for the the defined
component interfaces. Components implementations are provided by
component implementation specific projects define elsewhere.
