# src/

## Purpose

Source code.

This tree is only needed for **Development**. It is NOT needed for Deployment.

Contains implementations, emulations, tests, diagnostics of *interfaces*.

Interfaces are specified in [if/](../if/README.md) or may be *generic* interfaces 
specified via configurations defined in [res/cfg/](../res/cfg/README.md) directory.


## Organization

Sub-directories with an approriate organization.

Typically, there will be: 

- one sub-directory per *interface* implementation
  - may have sub-directories for implementation variants
- related implementations may be grouped under a common directory
