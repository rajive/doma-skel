# Bus

A *databus* is a data-centric information sharing technology that implements a virtual, global data space, where applications exchange data.

## Definition

A databus defines a collection of data-oriented service interfaces that use a common data model to exchange data. 

Key characteristics of a databus are:

- the [components](Component.md) directly interface with the operational data
- the databus implementation interprets and selectively filters the data, and
- the databus implementation imposes rules and manages quality of service (QoS) parameters, such as rate, reliability and security of data flow.


A databus is comprised of:
 - [Data Models](DataModel.md)
 - [Data-Oriented Services](Service.md)


## Organization

- [if/MyService.xml](../../if/README.md)


## Maintainer

The Databus is maintained by architecture team members, with expertise in system software architecture definition.
